# Arduino_OplaUI

This Arduino library provides user interface helpers and widgets for the [Arduino Opl√† IoT](https://store.arduino.cc/opla-iot-kit) Kit and the [MKR IoT Carrier](http://store.arduino.cc/mkr-iot-carrier).

With this library you can use the round display, the colored LEDs, the buzzer and the touch buttons to create an interactive user interface.

Features:

* 4 styles of gauges
* widget framework that makes it easy to combine multiple independent widgets in a single application (gauge, string, bool)
* use touch buttons to increase/decrease values
